## Setup

Participants should install and run before the workshop, so that any problems
may reveal themselves early.

## The dataset used

- The dataset used in this lesson can be downloaded from Figshare through the
  link in the [setup section](../learners/setup.md).
- It will need to be downloaded to the local machine before it can be loaded
  into OpenRefine.
- A general description of the dataset used in the Social Sciences lessons can
  be found [in the workshop data home page](https://datacarpentry.org/socialsci-workshop/data/).

## The Lessons

[Introduction](../episodes/01-introduction.md)

- Explains what OpenRefine is, what it is used for and where to get help.

[Working with OpenRefine](../episodes/02-working-with-openrefine.md)

- Covers the creation of an OpenRefine project using our dataset.
- Facets and clustering are introduced and there is a discussion on the
  different clustering algorithms and how they may produce different results.
- Splitting columns is covered as is undo/redo.

[Filtering and Sorting](../episodes/03-filter-sort.md)

- Using Include and Exclude from a facet is covered and the difference between
  faceting and filtering is explained.
- The various sort options for single or multiple columns is covered.

[Examining Numbers in OpenRefine](../episodes/04-numbers.md)

- Explains that everything is a string until you change it.
- Explains how to change the data type and the additional faceting ability it provides.

[Using scripts](../episodes/05-scripts.md)

- Explains how actions within a project can be copied to an external file and
  re-applied. The same file is used to re-apply the changes.

[Saving results](../episodes/06-saving.md)

- Covers the overall format of a project 'file' and how the components can be viewed.
- This may require installing additional software on Windows machine (e.g.
  7-zip) as the built-in un-zipping facility does not work with tar.gz files.

[Other resources in OpenRefine](../episodes/07-resources.md)

- Just a list of various OpenRefine resources available on-line (taken from the Ecology lessons)
