A part of the data workflow is preparing the data for analysis. Some of this
involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or
formatting made consistent. This step must be taken with the same care and
attention to reproducibility as the analysis.

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful free and open source tool for
working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into
another.

This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format
data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment
that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these
edits by hand.
