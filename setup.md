> ## Data
>
> The data for this lesson is a part of the Data Carpentry Social Sciences
> workshop. It is a teaching version of the Studying African Farmer-Led
> Irrigation (SAFI) database. The SAFI dataset represents interviews of farmers
> in two countries in eastern sub-Saharan Africa (Mozambique and Tanzania).
> These interviews were conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 and probed
> household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household
> members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), and assets (e.g. number
> and types of livestock).
> 
> The data used in this lesson
> is a subset of the teaching version that has been intentionally 'messed up'
> for this lesson.
