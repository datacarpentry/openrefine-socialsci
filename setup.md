> ## Data
>
> The data for this lesson is a part of the Data Carpentry Social Sciences
> workshop. It is a teaching version of the Studying African Farmer-Led
> Irrigation (SAFI) database. The SAFI dataset represents interviews of farmers
> in two countries in eastern sub-Saharan Africa (Mozambique and Tanzania).
> These interviews were conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 and probed
> household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household
> members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), and assets (e.g. number
> and types of livestock).
>
> The data used in this lesson
> is a subset of the teaching version that has been intentionally 'messed up'
> for this lesson.
>
> **Download** the data file to your computer by

> ## Software
>
> For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine** (formerly Google Refine) and a
> web browser.
>
> Note: this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud).
> It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed for this lesson.
> You do not need administrative rights on the computer to *install* OpenRefine.
> However, you may need administrative rights to allow OpenRefine to *run* if
> anti-malware software blocks the application. OpenRefine is safe to run.
