## Add functionality to OpenRefine using extensions

OpenRefine contains many functionalities for cleaning and enriching data by default,
as we have seen in this lesson.
Using GREL expressions (or other expression languages) we can transform data in many ways too.

In certain aspects OpenRefine's functionality can be extended by installing *extensions*.
There are extensions that allow importing and exporting other file types, as well as
extensions that provide new GREL functions.
The OpenRefine website provides a [list of extensions][ext], their functionality,
and what version(s) of OpenRefine each extension is compatible with.
Since extensions are maintained by community, sometimes they are not compatible with newest versions of OpenRefine.
